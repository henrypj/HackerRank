# Description
# Difficulty: Medium
# 
# Bomberman lives in a rectangular grid with R rows and C columns. Each cell in
# the grid either contains a bomb or nothing at all.
#
# Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but, once planted, it will 
# detonate after exactly 3 seconds. Once a bomb detonates, it's destroyed â€” 
# along with anything in its four neighboring cells. This means that if a bomb 
# detonates in cell i, j cells (i += 1,j) and (i,j += 1) are cleared (note that
# cells at the edge of the grid have less than four neighboring cells). If there
# is a bomb in a neighboring cell, the neighboring bomb is destroyed without 
# detonating (i.e., no chain reaction occurs).
#
# Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid. Here's
# what he does:
#
# 1. Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells.
# 2. After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
# 3. After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without bombs,
#    thus filling the whole grid with bombs. It is guaranteed that no bombs will
#    detonate at this second.
# 4. After one more second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago will 
#    detonate. Here, Bomberman stands back and observes.
# 5. Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.
#
# Note that during every second Bomberman plants bombs, the bombs are planted
# simultaneously (i.e., at the exact same moment), and any bombs planted at the
# same time will detonate at the same time.
#
# Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Bomberman's
# first batch of planted bombs, determine the state of the grid after N seconds.
#
# Input Format
#
# The first line contains three space-separated integers denoting the respective
# values of R, C, and N. 
# Each line i of the R subsequent lines describes row i of the grid's initial 
# state as a single string of C characters; the "." character denotes an empty
# cell, and the O character (ascii 79) denotes a bomb.
#
# Constraints
#
# 1 <= R,C <= 200
# 1 <= N <= 10**9
# 1 <= N <= 200 for 40% of the maximum score.
#
# Output Format 
#
# Print the grid's final state. This means R lines where each line contains C 
# characters, and each character is either a . or an O (ascii 79). This grid 
# must represent the state of the grid after N seconds.
#
# Example 0
#
# Given Input:
# 6 7 3
# .......
# ...0...
# ....0..
# .......
# 00.....
# 00.....
#
# Output:
# 000.000
# 00...00
# 000...0
# ..00.00
# ...0000
# ...0000
#
# Explanation:
# The initial state of the grid is as follows:
# .......
# ...0...
# ....0..
# .......
# 00.....
# 00.....
#    
# Bomberman spends the first second doing nothing, so the state after 1 second is: 
# .......
# ...0...
# ....0..
# .......
# 00.....
# 00.....
#
# Bomberman then plants bombs in all the empty cells during his second second,
# so this is the result after 2 seconds: 
# 0000000
# 0000000
# 0000000
# 0000000
# 0000000
# 0000000
#
# In his third second, Bomberman sits back and watches all the bombs he planted
# 3 seconds ago detonate. This is the final state after 3 seconds:
# 000.000
# 00...00
# 000...0
# ..00.00
# ...0000
# ...0000
#
# Example 1:
# 
# Given Input:
# 5 5 7
# ..OO.
# OO.O.
# ..O..
# .....
# O.O.O
#
# Output:
# .....
# .....
# ....O
# .O.O.
# .....
#
#
# Solution:
# My solution 1 functionally works, but times out on the larger N. After
# reading the discussion groups and testing with different input, I realized
# that there is no need to calculate the pattern for large N as there is a 
# repeating pattern. There are essentially 4 possibilities, the original input
# pattern, a pattern of all bombs, and two other patterns that repeat at 
# N % 4 == 3 (3,7,11,15...) and N % 4 == 1 (5,9,13,17...). Solution 2 calculates
# and saves these four patterns then displays the correct one for the given N.
