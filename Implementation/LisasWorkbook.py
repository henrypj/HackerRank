# Description
# Difficulty: Easy
# 
# Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, 
# grouped into chapters.
#
# - There are n chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from 1 to n.
# - The i-th chapter has t(i) problems, numbered from 1 to t(i).
# - Each page can hold up to k problems. There are no empty pages or unnecessary
#   spaces, so only the last page of a chapter may contain fewer than k problems.
# - Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems
#   from more than one chapter.
# - The page number indexing starts at 1.
#
# Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the
# same as the page number where it's located. Given the details for Lisa's 
# workbook, can you count its number of special problems?
# 
# Input Format
#
# The first line contains two integers n and k â€” the number of chapters and the
# maximum number of problems per page respectively. 
# The second line contains n integers t(1),t(2),...,t(n), where t(i) denotes the
# number of problems in the i-th chapter.
#
# Constraints
#
# 1 <= n,k,t(i) <= 100
#
# Output Format 
#
# Print the number of special problems in Lisa's workbook.
#
# Example
#
# Given Input:
# 5 3
# 4 2 6 1 10
#
# Output:
# 4
#
# Explanation:
# The diagram below depicts Lisa's workbook with n=5 chapters and a maximum of
# k=3 problems per page. Special problems are surrounded in brackets [], and 
# page numbers are in surrounded in parenthesis ().
